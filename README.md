# DV component library

Step 1: open a command prompt from your DV-WEB-COMP libarary and run 
        command: npm run packagr

        Above command would create a DIST folder in the same directory.
      
Step 2: from inside DIST folder open a command prompt and run command          NPM PACK.

        This will generate a node module of your currnt project in the form of a TGZ file.
        
        To use node module, this TGZ file would be used while performing NPM Install.
