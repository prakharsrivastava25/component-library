# Component Library

Step 1: open a command prompt from your component-library and run 
        command: 'npm run packagr'

        Above command would create a dist folder in the same directory.
      
Step 2: from inside dist folder open a command prompt and run command: 'npm pack'

        This will generate a node module of your currnt project in the form of a TGZ file.
        
        To use node module, this TGZ file would be used while performing NPM Install.
